Easy to set up and use. Projection 2003 TV into a smart TV. Then I log onto Netflix and Amazon prime to watch videos on this TV. I love the Roku. It works great.
Love this TV. The picture quality is amazing. We are over the moon about our new TV. Coupled with the Samsung sound bar and Woofer, I don't ever need to go to the movie theater again. That also means the TV remote could be used instead of their Remotes. Do not get a Samsung TV.
The noise cancelling is fantastic. These are the best Headphones I've ever owned. Well worth the money! The batteries last a long time and charge quickly. I have the over the ears pair and also these in the ears.
Very fast and powerful! Great processor. Is a beast of a processor. Upgraded from the I5 6600K. I have had no problems with this Cpu. I don't know what else to say, I don't have anything that I can throw at it that will make it stutter.
Love this camera! Great upgrade from my canon 6D! The touch screen is superb. It's a game Changer camera.
This is a great monitor for travelling. Only worked with a Usb-3 port. Product stopped working after 1 month. I love this monitor. Do not buy this!! It's lightweight and thin. Poor quality.
Love this TV! Great picture and sound. The picture quality is amazing! I like the TV itself. Great TV for the price! I have to unplug and restart frequently.
It even makes the factory speakers sound better!! Loving this radio! She uses it everyday and it works great! Very easy to install. Touch screen is very responsive. Great head unit for the price. The apple Carplay is fantastic!
Want it to play on your Android device? So now you can watch TV ads and Slingbox ads! It works great. I do not like the ads that I'm forced to watch on the App just to connect to my own box. Use it to stream baseball and Soccer games regularly. The interface on the setup is a nightmare to use.
Love this lens. Great lens. Great for Low-Light!
Shame because the sound quality is great. These are an excellent pair of Headphones. Excellent sound and very comfortable to wear. Good quality Headphones, sound is excellent and the battery life is good. Premium materials gives good look and feel.
The battery life is impressive. Fast and effective. This is a great laptop Chromebook. Almost every 20 minutes and I have to restart it each time. It is just what I needed. Easy to throw in a bag and the battery lasts forever!!! I love this Chromebook. Waste of money.
This camera is awesome! Easy to set up and connect. It constantly Disconnects from Smarthings and I have to reset the camera. Picture quality is great.
The picture quality is awesome. Love this TV. Great picture and sound quality. I would only Ding the TV for the remote. Very easy to set up and update. Really enjoy the great Video on the TV.
I love this camera. Super easy to use and takes great pictures. Am a novice photographer. I roll with Nikon's 35Mm Af-S lens myself, which is great for both close-up portraits as well as grand landscape shots. The retractable lens that comes with the camera keeps the size of the camera to a minimum. 
Love this Speaker. The battery life is good. The volume, the Bass, the sound quality...what's not to like about a Bose ... This Speaker sounds great. Very easy to connect. Love it!!!!!
These are the best Headphones I have ever heard. Really great sound quality. Just slightly Bass-Heavy, which I like. They are solid, feel comfortable and sound well balanced.  I like the sound and build quality of the Headphones but you cannot enjoy something which you can't even wear for more than 15 minutes. Expensive, but worth it.
I use a combination MS mouse / keyboard that is connected directly to the 3.0 Usb port. I didn't want to wear out the Usb ports on my laptop. These are great Usb 3.0 hubs. It works great. The Cable is way too short for this thing. Wish the cord was longer. Another great product from Anker!!! I also have an external disc plugged in to it, ready to use any time I need it.
This is awesome and super fast so much space for my Xbox one X love this hard drive. This hard drive is awesome. 6 months in it stopped working. Plug and play! It's very easy to install and format for the Xbox one. Know I have plenty of space on my Xbox.
Great little camera. The camera is small and compact and the pictures are good. This camera is slow to respond to commands. It takes excellent pictures. It is not great for action shots. Unfortunately my pictures turned out Grainy and out of focus even when I used a prop to hold the camera still when shooting. Easy to use and good pictures! I had purchased a canon Elf first and I hated it.
I love this camera. The increase in the quality of the pictures that I have taken with this camera is stunning. Uses canon lenses. It is easy to use and takes great pictures. Brand new!! Very pleased! We gave as a Christmas gift to my parents.
It looks nice and the Headphones (K7Xxs) look great on it. It looks great and works really well. Does the job. It's pretty flimsy. The design of the Headphone stand looks really good. :) exactly what I needed. The stand is built sturdy and thicker than I expected.
It was very easy to setup the Router. I have a Ps3, home Audio receiver, and other ports hooked up to these. The signal is much, much stronger than it had been in the house. Have had this Router for awhile now. No complaints. I got this Router to replace my Linksys that just keeled over. After getting this Router my Internet is so much faster.
Very disappointed in Asus.
This scanner is fast, and very forgiving of imperfect originals. Super fast and easy to use. This scanner does not scan directly to a cloud service. It does double sided scanning. So far so good. Big waste of time.
I love this keyboard. The two rows of keys located on the left side cause me problems. I like the keys. Typing on it is nice and so much more comfortable than even my split Microsoft (Ergonomic) keyboard.
This case is great. It's a very sturdy case. Plenty of room for extra controllers. Fits everything you need to travel with the switch! This carrying case is perfect and fits multiple components! Holds my switch, games, and accessories for less cost than the name brand. My son loves it.
This is a great Cpu. Really good GPU for the price. I was able to get mine Overclocked to 4.0 Ghz, and I don't see temps above 60 degrees on stress tests. Great for a mid range gaming rig or everyday use. Has not had any issues running the newest games. Pair it with a good tower cooler and you'll be good to go! So much better than the old Fx 8320...night and day fast ... My wife uses it with all the Adobe programs and it's working fine.
These are great little binoculars! Small and easy to carry. Great for bird watching as well. They are light weight and very portable! I bought these for an Alaskan cruise.
Can't comment about blue tooth, Wireless, etc.  Zero customer service. Prior to the trip, I tried it in the us and managed to get traffic to connect only a few times.   It is great I always had Garmin Gps. 
 Great product! Easy to use. The Backlight went out so now it ’ s useless as you can ’ t REAS the screen.   
This is a great camera for traveling. The photos are fantastic, and the movies are great, too! Works well in low light.
This is a great little radio! Great radio for the price! Battery life is good. So I am new to ham radio. Do yourself a favor and get the $20 programming Cable. Easy to program. Radio works great.
Picked this up for an external hard drive for my Ps4. This is a great Hard-Drive. I tried several computers to no avail. Fast and reliable. If you want it to hold game data you will have to install it internally. Plug and play.
The sound quality is great. These are the best Headphones I have ever owned. A lot of connection issues, which you have to put them back in the case, Disconnect and Reconnect them to resolve the connection issue. The battery life is amazing. Noise cancellation is non Exinsistant. I will be returning them. I am very disappointed with the Powerbeats pro Earbuds.
Great camera!  Excellent build and picture quality.  I've been a long time user of the Fuji X-Series cameras (X100, X100S, X-Pro1, X-E1, X-E2). The build quality of the X-T1 is just amazing. The image quality is fantastic, the Useability is joyful. 
Great TV for the price. The picture quality is great. The speakers are on the bottom of the TV and they point down. There are far too many glitches with the TV randomly turning on and the home screen not loading. The Vizio App is slow to load and constantly drops Internet connection. Deep blacks and vibrant colors.
Great camera for the price. This is my first Digital Slr and I am very pleased with it. It even tells me when I'm in focus. The menu is user friendly and the camera is generally easy to use. The lens Itelf is top notch.   The price from Amazon was amazing.
This is a great Router. The Router frequent drops the Wifi signal. Now nothing connected to the Wifi is dependable for Internet or Intranet service. It greatly improved the Wifi in my house. Real easy to setup. I needed a strong signal from a Wireless Router. I have the latest Firmware and still having the same issue. Set up instructions were not great but seems to work well.
I love this bag!! Great bag! Fits my 17" laptop with room to spare. This sturdy bag is the perfect antidote to Backpacks. The leather is high quality and the Stitching is very tight. The negative I have for it is that it comes with only one pocket in the main body of the bag.
I liked the sound even better the I expected. I am using these speakers in my home theater system & the sound is Susperb. Sounds great. Paired with a Yamaha receiver. Very happy with these speakers. Needed to replace my rear speakers of my 7.1 system. You will not be disappointed!
Super fast start up. - battery life is horrible. Although this one is fast, the fan is extremely loud and will start up even when there are no major programs running.  It is very fast. Don't waste your money. So far so good but it's been a hassle.
You can voice control each power outlet and Usb ports. It just stopped working out of the blue. Easy to connect, easy to setup, easy Pairing with Alexa. After moving, I cannot get it to connect to the Wifi. This thing is handy as all get out! Turned off and wouldn ’ t turn on anymore. Waste of money!
I have not hooked it up as a monitor, it will be used primarily as a TV. I love this TV. I'm using it as a monitor and it's great for that. At 4K resolution refresh rate is at 30Hz. A nice Uhd TV for the price. The picture is fantastic. The speakers are also terrible as others have said. Resolution is amazing, plus is quite thin.
 No problems. Good buy! Operated for about a minute then disconnected from service. This computer is a piece of crap. Suits my needs.  
I love this printer! Easy to set-up. It prints fast and comes out great. The print quality is great. As a business owner I need to print envelopes with my logo on them.
Plug and play. Started to use only for Downloading CDs and Dvds on my computer. Very good CD? Dvd drive. I purchased it to use with my Macbook air and it works fine. It works great. But did not work. Surface pro 3 does not have enough power to run this unit. It is cheap and works, but it is difficult to open.
Very easy to install. I tried for days to get it to work but to no avail. The Wifi signal is strong and steady. Next I called Comcast to have them "hit" the Modem and then it was up and running. This Router was so East to install. My Internet is so much faster than my old one. Haven't had any issues with it yet.
This is a great Bluetooth Speaker. The battery life is not what was mentioned. Gets very loud while keeping the sound quality. Love this Speaker.  Very good value for money. Overall great product and the pros easily outweigh the Cons, considering buying a third!
Great sound and doesn't take a lot of space. Bought this to go with a Polk Audio sound bar at my store. The sound exceeded my expectations in a compact and sleek package. Highly recommend! I am very happy with the Psw111.  Sounds great.

They heat evenly and are easy to clean. You ’ ll need a Non-Stick pan. The pans are very heavy. Very easy to clean and nice looking. The food sticks to the pans. I love this Cookware. They clean up beautifully.
But this one is stronger and the battery last longer. This is a great little vacuum. For my use, the battery life is great. I use this on my laminate flooring and carpets. I love this vacuum!!!! Picks up cat hair and dirt. It is great on hardwood floors and tile, I have never used it on rugs.
Easy to clean. And it is great for seafood and vegetable! We use it for beef Burgers, Vegi Burgers, Turkey Burgers, chicken breasts, Paninis, Grilled-Cheese, and Pancakes. I love this Griddler! Clean up is a breeze. And we haven't used a Frypan since we've had this! It HEATS up quickly and cooks food evenly.
Very easy to clean and very even heating. It HEATS up quickly. It makes great sandwiches and didn't cost a lot. Bought it to make grilled cheese sandwiches. I love this Panini press! The bread comes out nice and Crispy. Love it.
Easy to install! I love this! I have attached it to the mirror and it's held up the last 4 weeks. We're also able to store some things like toothpaste, lotion, nail files, etc.
9 MOS old and it stopped working! Heats up fast and the grill option is nice. I love this Microwave! It does what it ’ s supposed to but it can be a bit loud when Microwaving things. Works great for the Microwave. It over HEATS and shuts off.
I can ’ t believe the quality - they are so beautiful!!! One of the kids came Dentend. I love these pots and pans. High quality very nice stainless steel set! I ’ M very disappointed in this product.
It is very quiet. Awsome just plain Awsome plenty of room both in the freezer and Fridge. The Fridge is nice but was delivered with a huge dent in the front door. And it's not noisy. This is perfect for my room. We got this Fridge to supplement the Fridge in our apartment that freezes every type of produce.
The fabric is soft and quite pliable. One more plus, it is made in the USA. I have a memory foam Mattress and was looking for a Mattress protector that would not inhibit the give of my Mattress. Highly recommend this product. Have washed and dried it twice and it has held up very well!
Very easy to assemble. It is very sturdy and tall although the tops of the wood shelves are very Bumpy/Lumpy. Looks great. One of the shelves arrived broken.
I like a firm Mattress, but it's a little too firm. Love this Mattress! No more back pain in the morning. This is the best Mattress I have ever used. Had high hopes for this Mattress, there are so many reviews that where good and it seemed to work for everyone. It does not get hot.
Very easy to clean. Makes great French Fries and fried chicken. It allows me to filter and store the oil between uses. This is the best fryer I have ever bought. I love this deep fryer. After draining the oil everything goes in the Dishwasher! It heat up fast too.
I use it mainly to make grilled cheese sandwiches. Easy to clean. It HEATS up fast, constant heat. We use it for Bagels, sourdough, wraps, Burritos, etc. Love this Panini press. The crust is Crispy and the inside is creamy and moist. Purchased as a gift for my son for Christmas.
It was easy to assemble. This frame is very sturdy. Lots of space underneath for storage. Love this bed frame! Also the Mattress itself keeps sinking into the frame. Get on the bed and the Mattress goes sliding around. It took me about 20-30 minutes to put together alone.
This is the best coffee maker I have ever owned. Makes a great cup of coffee. This coffee maker is expensive but if you enjoy the true flavor of the coffee you have purchased, this pot will let you enjoy that. The Carafe keeps the coffee hot for few hours. It is worth the money.
I love this little iron! It HEATS up quickly and the steam is sufficient. I use this iron as I'm working on my textile projects. It is great for travel and for smaller pieces. I like the size of this iron however that ’ s about it.
Just throw some food in turn it on and when you get home from work, dinner is ready. I love this Crock pot. It cooks great. Once the Timer is complete, it automatically goes to keep warm setting. This thing gets way too hot even on low. Useful, easy to clean, and easy to use.
Easy to use, easy to clean. Opted for "commercial" grade this time. We love this Microwave! So far good.
This vacuum is awesome. The suction is great. It picks up every particle possible and all of the hair. I have hardwood floors and tile floors throughout my home. It does a great job! It is light weight and easy to use.
I was able to quickly take the pits out of 5 lbs of cherries. So much easier than manually Pitting cherries! It works like a charm! (and some of the pits are to large and get stuck in the hole). This is great for putting up cherries for the season. Does the job!
Very sturdy and a perfect height to raise the head of the bed. Lifted the bed to just the right height. One of them broke suddenly! Double stacked them to raise the head of bed. The do the job. Our queen bed sits nicely on these with plenty of room for storage boxes underneath.
I love this coffee maker. I can make one cup of coffee at a time W/ regular coffee grounds and don't have to give in to the Envioronment-Destroying K-Cups fiasco! Makes a good cup of coffee. Easy to use and easy to clean! The coffee is not hot.
I loved this rice Cooker. However, the rice Cooker always burns the bottom of my rice. Cooks rice perfectly! It is easy to use and easy to clean. It comes with a measuring cup and a Spatula.
Best broom set I have ever owned. I like everything about this broom and Dustpan. I like the teeth on the dust pan to pull out dust and hair that gets stuck in the broom bristles. I love this broom! No more bending over. This is cute, handy, and durable, but the broom is a bit small (don ’ t expect the width of a standard kitchen broom).
It is soft and comfortable. This is a very high quality Mattress pad. Washed it and it held up perfectly. It stays in place and completely covers the Mattress. The quality is superb and the price is fair.
Great coffee maker. I had to have a glass mug to dispense the coffee and then serve from mug to Styrofoam cups. We use it for coffee and for hot water for tea and hot chocolate at parties and events! Makes good coffee. The coffee doesn't come out. Everything is easy to clean and put back together. Puts out very hot coffee.
Easy to assemble. It is a much darker gray than the picture shows. It's annoying but I love the color and the style. This is a beautiful piece of furniture. Unfortunately, mine arrived with some damage; a big chip on the top Corner.Very easy to put together. A little darker than the picture shows.
Love this fan. Great fan. Very cheaply made. Easy to assemble. And it's quiet too! Love this fan. All plastic.
It is very quiet. It takes a lot of water out of the air. Barely half a cup of water after a day in a 80F room. Completely stopped working after a little more than a year. It's small, fairly quiet and does a great job. It works great in our bathroom. Worked great for a year and a half, then just died.
Pretty easy to remove the ice. They don't stay on or latch in anyway to the tray. Such a fantastic set of trays. To freeze tomato paste, lemon juice, broth. I love that these have lids! Just easily flip it over, push the Silicon part and the ice cube Pops out. The Silicon bottom in these trays are amazing!!
If you like the edges, you will love this pan. Makes great Brownies. The Brownies turned out great! Very heavy duty. Super easy to clean. Bought this as a gift for my mom she liked it. The Brownies came out perfect!
I use these to Bake bacon on in the oven. Fits perfectly in my half sheet pan. Easy to clean! They fit in the cookie sheet and are great as a cooling rack. The rack is very sturdy and strong.
This is a great little tea kettle. It looks great on the stove and boils water well. I love this pot! The glass is a little thin for my liking. - nice size for one or Mb two people. It is beautiful but I got a steam burn the first time I used it. Bonus that this is easy to clean and see though. This item broke after 6 months of use.
My daughter loves this bed! The bed is very sturdy. It creates so much more space in the room. The instructions were easy to follow. Took a good 3 hours to put together. The bed is also quite wobbly to climb on.
The single serve side Spits coffee all over the counter. I love this coffee maker. Unfortunately, the single cup side of the coffee maker has some Kinks. It makes a good cup of coffee. The K-Cup Spigot splashes everywhere and makes a mess all over the counter. The coffee is hot and stays hot on the warmer.
I have dried all sorts of fruits, Proofed bread, and used it to make yogurt. Turned out great. It is a little loud. I love my Excalibur. This is the best Dehydrator I have ever owned. Easy to clean.
It is noisy, there is not denying that. Otherwise it does cool the House very quickly. Very responsive customer service.     The inventor chilly is quiet compared to other makes.
Easy to use and easy to clean. I use this to stuff summer sausage and snack stick links. Heavy duty. Love this Stuffer. This is a great piece of equipment. Great product.
Really Shined up my hardwood floors. My floors look fabulous!! I used this product on my wood floors. Great product! This is the best. Highly recommend!
Very easy to use and Refill. I love this salt and pepper grinder set. These are the best I have ever seen.
Easy to assemble. It is a great corner shelf. It's perfect for what I needed. Poles are plastic and shelves are wood. It took me less than 5 minutes to put it together.
Everyone who uses it loves it, and it looks great. This is a beautiful Decanter. It is also quite substantial in size and weight. It is tricky pouring the last glass or so. Love this Decanter. Very nice. It was reasonably priced and is quite elegant.
The Mattress is firm, but not uncomfortably so. I love this Mattress. The smell went away completely after a few weeks. It is a very comfortable Mattress. This bed is amazing! This is the best Mattress I have ever had.
I love this iron. If you do any amount of ironing, this is definitely the iron to have! I have had this iron since April 2016 and I love it. Lots of steam.

I love these glasses. Purchased the Epare wine glasses to use with coffee in the morning. Keep white wines cold. One of the glasses cracked on the very first use. These wine glasses are quite large, but very light. Just finished washing them in the Dishwasher, and the did not leak. They were a great gift to our friend in California.
Very nice cutting boards. This Neet is heavy and stays in place. It is thick and heavy, and looks great on the counter! It looks very well made.    I absolutely love the handles on the sides for easy movement from counter to table.
This is a great saucepan like all of the copper core line. It HEATS up quickly and maintains its heat for even cooking. Only draw back is they are a little heavy. Very expensive but worth every Penny. Handle doesn't get hot and it is easy to clean. The food cooks very evenly and clean up is a breeze. One of the best pans I've ever owned.
I had issues with it connecting to my phone using Bluetooth so I had to connect with Wifi. The battery life is fantastic! It tracks my steps and sleep. I really like this watch. I love the sleep tracking. The heart rate monitor seems to be pretty accurate on me. Very disappointing.

This bench is great for taller people like myself. This is a solid well made bench. Easy to assemble. Great bench! - it took about 15 Mins to put together. There is a big gap between the seat and the back rest. I love this bench. My only complaint is the metal support bar that adjusts the bench position (extending from the back of the bench).

Love these gloves!! Good wrist support. Great gloves. I have been lifting for over 20 years and have used owned about 15 different gloves.

It doesn't fog at all. This mask Hugs your face. The best mask ever!!! It's well worth the money.  Great mask.  My son loves it.
The heart rate monitor seems to be accurate. The battery lasts about 5 days. I love the notification features. It will not connect. Love keeping track of my steps and heart rate sleep patterns and more! I've had this for a year now.
Seems to be very accurate. Does not work well. We use it for baseball pitching of 12 year old boys. Great for checking pitching speeds. Tried to return it and no returns accepted. The speed of the gun was not accurate, and when I measured it, I found it was not the same as the real speed. The kids also think it's fun to check our dogs speed.
I love the bike. Nice and quiet and well made! I purchased the bike in May. Easy to assemble. It just didn ’ t work. However, when it was delivered the box was so destroyed they had damaged areas of the bike. I am buying a Garmin heart rate monitor to follow my heart and my daily activities.

 My daughter loves them. These are highly uncomfortable. Bought these for my daughter. They fit perfectly.

They're a little hard to get on and off, but fit really well when on. Absolutely love these gloves! I just use them to swim around and they work great!
This coffee pot is great. The first time I used this, the glass top broke right off. Can't wait to go camping! The lid didn't fit when we took it out of the box and the rod part of the percolator was bent. This percolator Brews a good cup of coffee. Cheaply made. Also, the basket Assembly if very flimsy aluminum and would not last long anyway. Makes a big pot of coffee.

I love the design. I bought the purple Daisy and it is beautiful. The handle broke after the first time I used it. I got one as a gift for Xmas. This is a great umbrella. I haven ’ t had a chance to use it. The umbrellas look very sturdy.
It is very sturdy and works in my door frame great. Easy to assemble. This is a great pull up bar. I weigh 165 and it Flexes when I use it. Therefore, you're unable to fully tighten the screws.". This will leave a few small holes in the top of the door trim. Does not fit standard door frame.
The kids love them, plenty so no one is fighting for them. Within a week, most were lumpy. Every kid should have a good old solid playground ball, and this one is awesome. Cute and perfect for kids of all ages. Cracked and leaked air.   I like that they come with a bag to carry and store in.
These tires seem to be a great replacement. Great mountain bike tire for my trek am bicycle. I used this to replace a worn tire on a trek Marlin 5 mountain bike. They're affordable though and seem to have pretty good grip on trails and street. Very nice tire. Easy to install. Exceptionally smooth riding on pavement.
Tried to get it to connect to my Fitbit account and it never connected properly. The scale is accurate, and measures my weight quickly. I love this scale. Very easy to set up and sync.

They smell like wet paint. We had so much fun!! Bought these for a school party. All the kids had a great time. Smelt horrible. It is a very strong chemical smell. They held up well for at least 5 races. They worked well.

I was introduced to this device in physical therapy. I ordered this Bosu balance Trainer to help with my balance and to use it to increase my exercise ability. It really helps strengthen your core.
