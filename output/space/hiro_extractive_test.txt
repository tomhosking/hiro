The room was small but very Managable .. I only went there to sleep. The elevators were Alittle slow. If you are all about sight seeing and not being in the room much, this is the hotel for you! This hotel is in a great location, walking distance to the magnificent mile. The price was right. The staff was very rude (with the exception of one Lady).
The room was clean and quiet. If you are looking for shiny new modern, then this is not the place for you. As previous posters have mentioned, the furniture is a little worn and dated. The hotel seems more like a small apartment building than a hotel. Being so close to Grand central station. The hotel was not a bad place to stay. The price is very reasonable and I find the suites extremely comfortable.
The beds and linens are also top of the line. Only complaint was that the room was warm even with AC Cranked. The staff was unbelievably accommodating and helpful, especially the manager. Great location - between 5th Avenue and times square. Room service was prompt.

Other reviews have said noise was not a problem, so it might depend on where your room is. The pool and hot tub were fun for my son.
The balcony had a great view of the beach. The hotel Erwin delivers. The restaurant (lush) was amazing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It was great. If you want to stay in Venice, this is a great place to be.
